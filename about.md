Hello, I'm Sachin Maheshwari. 

I'm a Software Engineer from Bangalore, India. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, clean and intuitive solutions. 

These are few of my personal projects that you can checkout.
1. [Stock Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sm.stock.StockTracker) - An Android app that can be used for tracking stocks price. 
2. [Mind Games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sm.mindgames) - It's an educational game to improve focus and basic mathematical skills.
