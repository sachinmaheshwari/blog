Why productivity matters?



We all have 24 hours to do whatever we want every day. And we have few choices about how to spend these 24 hours.

1. Go with the flow (or time) and do whatever comes to us.
2. Take control of our time and do what you want to do and at what time.

If we go with the flow, then soon we will realise that we are having lot of stress and the work life balance is tilting dangerously towards work. Let's say for e.g. on every new email that comes to us if we are stopping whatever we are doing to read that email. Then after reading that email either we will go back to our original work that we were doing or we might decide to reply that email. Both of these choices will lead to break in our thought flow or zone that we were in when we got the email first. Now to get back to that zone we will need to re-collect everything related to what we were doing. Now this might look like a simple thing, but if we do it multiple times then all such single things collectively tires our brain. And we will feel the effect at the end of the day. This is only what emails can do to us. But we also have phone calls, text messages, neighbours asking for some random stuff and so on. 

On the other hand, if we control what can interrupt us and focus on what we want to do and at what time then we will soon feel that we are actually spending more time on the things that matters. And at the end of the day we will feel less tired as the overhead of going back to the zone is no longer there.
