Why productivity matters?



We all have 24 hours to do whatever we want in a single day. We have few choices about what to do with these 24 hours: 

1. Go with the flow (or time) and do whatever comes to us.
2. Take control of our time and do what you want to do and at what time?

If we go with the flow, then soon we will realise that we are having lot of stress and the work life balance is tilting dangerously towards work.

Who invented it?
